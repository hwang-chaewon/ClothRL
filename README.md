# Cloth Manipulation Using Deep RL for a Dual Robot Arm

## Introduction
This repository contains code for the Cloth Manipulation Using Deep Reinforcement Learning project, which performs a cloth unfolding task using SAC (Soft Actor-Critic) and HER (Hindsight Experience Replay) algorithms with two Franka Emika Panda robot arms.  

The environment setup uses the MuJoCo physics engine and OpenAI Gym on Ubuntu 20.04 or 22.04.
